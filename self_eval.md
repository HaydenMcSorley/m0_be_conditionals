# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
# when there is more than one path that your code can go down
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
# If I could do this again for the first time I would google stuff from the very beginning instead of getting down about myself for not knowing everything off the top of my head or from notes
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
# I guess I was most satisfied when I finally realised that not only is it okay to look to google for help/answers, but its actually encouraged.
